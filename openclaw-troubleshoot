# Troubleshoot OpenClaw

## agent not responsive

`openclaw agent --agent [agent_name] --message "/new"` - if u dont know the agent name then its main



## in case this error:

`[openclaw] missing tool result in session history; inserted synthetic error result for transcript repair`

you really dont have alot to go with, its an open issue, session files got corrupted, usually by some code-error that causes infinite loop. copy the files to backup folder

* `openclaw gateway stop`
* `mv ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions.bak`
* if you dont know your <agentId> then its `main`
* `openclaw gateway start --force`
  
if you miss some data you can ask the agent to look at backup folder, and even ask for the specific root reason.
  
mine for example was trying to push a big complicated script to another server, others report giviing too many queued messages.


## onboard not allowing to choose provider
`npx openclaw ...` seems to not be working fully, at least not on windows








# uninstall
sometimes it reallly breaks

## steps to fully uninstall
* `openclaw gateway stop`
* `mv ~/.openclaw ~/my.openclaw.bak` - create backup
* `openclaw uninstall`
* `npm uninstall -g openclaw`
* `rm -rf ~/.openclaw`

test (should see empty lists)
* `systemctl --user list-units | grep openclaw`
* `ps aux | grep openclaw`
* `kill <PID>` - if not empty lists

`grep --color=auto openclaw` - that is you, not an openclaw proccess
